# API Documentation That Developers Actually Use

Great API documentation is the difference between developers loving your API and abandoning it for alternatives. Yet most API docs fail because they're written for the documentation team, not the developers who actually use them.

## What Developers Need

### Quick Wins
Developers often arrive at your documentation with specific tasks and tight deadlines. They need:
- **Clear getting started guide**: Working code example in under 5 minutes
- **Interactive exploration**: Test API calls without writing code
- **Real use cases**: Examples that match their actual problems
- **Error handling**: What goes wrong and how to fix it

### Comprehensive Reference
Once hooked, developers need complete information:
- **All endpoints documented**: No hidden or undocumented features
- **Request/response examples**: Real JSON, not abstract schemas
- **Authentication flows**: Step-by-step with actual tokens
- **Rate limiting details**: Understand constraints upfront

## Documentation Structure

### 1. Getting Started (The Critical First 10 Minutes)

```markdown
# Quick Start
1. Get your API key
2. Make your first request
3. See real data

## Hello World Example
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://api.example.com/v1/users/me
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "id": "user_123",
  "name": "Jane Developer",
  "email": "jane@example.com"
}
```
```

### 2. Authentication Deep Dive
Don't just list authentication methods—show the complete flow:
- How to register for API keys
- Token refresh mechanisms
- Scopes and permissions
- Common authentication errors

### 3. Core Concepts
Explain your API's mental model:
- Key resources and relationships
- Common workflows
- Data models and constraints
- Naming conventions

### 4. Reference Documentation
For each endpoint, include:
- Purpose and use cases
- Complete parameter descriptions
- Multiple request examples
- All possible responses
- Error codes and solutions

## Interactive Features

### API Explorer
Let developers test calls directly:
- Pre-filled authentication
- Parameter forms
- Live request/response
- Code generation in multiple languages

### Code Examples
Provide working examples in popular languages:
- cURL for universal compatibility
- JavaScript for web developers
- Python for data scientists
- Go for backend developers

### SDKs and Libraries
Official libraries reduce friction:
- Consistent patterns across languages
- Built-in error handling
- Automatic retries and rate limiting
- Type definitions for IDE support

## Quality Checklist

### Accuracy
- [ ] All examples actually work
- [ ] Error responses match reality
- [ ] Code samples use current API version
- [ ] Screenshots reflect current UI

### Completeness
- [ ] Every endpoint documented
- [ ] All parameters explained
- [ ] Error conditions covered
- [ ] Edge cases addressed

### Usability
- [ ] Searchable content
- [ ] Mobile-friendly design
- [ ] Fast loading times
- [ ] Logical navigation

### Freshness
- [ ] Updated with each API release
- [ ] Deprecated features marked
- [ ] Migration guides for breaking changes
- [ ] Community feedback incorporated

## Common Pitfalls

### Over-Technical Writing
Remember your audience includes:
- Junior developers learning APIs
- Experienced developers in a hurry
- Non-native English speakers
- People switching between platforms

Write for clarity, not to impress.

### Missing Context
Don't just document what your API does—explain why developers would use it and how it fits into larger workflows.

### Static Examples
Generic "foo" and "bar" examples don't help developers understand real use cases. Use domain-relevant examples that developers can relate to their actual problems.

## Measuring Success

Track metrics that matter:
- **Time to first successful API call**
- **Documentation page completion rates**
- **Support ticket volume for documented topics**
- **Developer onboarding speed**
- **API adoption rates**

Great API documentation isn't just a reference—it's a product that enables developers to be successful with your API. Invest in it accordingly.
