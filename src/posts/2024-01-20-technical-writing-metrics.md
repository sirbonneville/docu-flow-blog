# Measuring Success: Key Metrics for Technical Writing Teams

Technical writing teams often struggle with demonstrating their value and impact within organizations. Unlike sales or marketing teams with clear revenue metrics, documentation teams need different approaches to measure success.

## Essential Documentation Metrics

### User Engagement Metrics
- Page views and unique visitors
- Time spent on documentation pages
- Search queries and popular content
- User feedback and satisfaction scores

### Quality Indicators
- Content freshness and update frequency
- Broken link monitoring
- Accessibility compliance scores
- Translation coverage for global teams

### Business Impact Metrics
- Support ticket reduction
- Developer onboarding time
- API adoption rates
- Customer success correlation

## Implementation Strategies

Start with baseline measurements and establish regular reporting cadences. Use tools like Google Analytics, Hotjar, or specialized documentation platforms to gather data consistently.

Remember: metrics should drive improvement, not just measurement for measurement's sake.
